Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
"Be-Bop-A-Lula, " "Baby What I Say"
Here comes Johnny singing, "I Gotta Woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Woohoo
